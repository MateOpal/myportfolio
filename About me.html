                <p>My full name is Adeniran Temitope Matthew. Since a very a young age has web development been a 
                    passion for me. <br>
                    I toyed with the movies that involved coding and hacking but as soon as I could use the internet in 
                    my 2nd junior high school year I started learning the basics of HTML.
                    Then the only resource available was a text editor for writting the codes and my chrome for outputting my codes. 
                    I knew little of CSS and have never heard of Javascript at the time but times did change.<br>
                    The real change came after I got into a Med school. I hail from Nigeria and I am a Sophomore student of College of Medicine University Of Lagos.

                I got my own personal computer and I clikced back into web development then I discovered that I had missed a lot over the years
                Though overwhelming I got back on track and I latched onto learning HTML5, CSS and Javascript.<br>
                A tough journey as it was coupled with my schooling.

                </figure>
                The journey made me better today as it taught me about time management and perserverance which were the 
                bedrock of my survival. Meet my first computer set up when I got into Web development<br>
